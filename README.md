This project is an assignment that I completed to fulfill the requirements of the [MIT Professional Certificate in Coding using MERN.](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?u)  

The assignment is about creating a real-time bus tracker. The data is fetched real-time using the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) API portal. Specifically, the program pulls Bus Route 1 data (bus that travels on Mass Ave passing through MIT and Harvard. Buses are tracked on the map by calling Google Maps API 

## Repository File Structure
There are five files required to run the Eyes exercise. All five files are listed in this repository: 

* **[index.html](https://github.com/pngom/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/blob/main/index.html)**
* **[mapanimation.js](https://github.com/pngom/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/blob/main/mapanimation.js)**
* **[styles.css](https://github.com/pngom/Eye-Exercise/blob/main/styles.css)**
* **[blue.png](https://github.com/pngom/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/blob/main/blue.png)**
* **[red.png](https://github.com/pngom/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/blob/main/red.png)**


## How to run the Real Time Bus Tracker
It is important to keep the same file structure when dowloading the files to run the Real Time Bus Tracker on your local computer. The html, javascript (.js), styles (.css) and image (.png) files should be kept in the same directory. Note that both the styles and javascript files are called by the html file. Therefore the program will not run if the files are renamed unless the file references are updated accordingly. 

1. Download the index.html, mapanimation.js, styles.css, blue.png and red.png to the same directory on your computer
2. Open an Internet browser window (e.g. using Google Chrome) and drag and drop the index.html onto the page
3. The map is diplayed with bus traveling real time in opposite directions (color coded blue and red). Note that the Google Maps API key used in this project is for development purposes only. You can view a clean map by replacing the Google API key with your own at line 4 of the index.html file. 
    

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Ability to click on a bus and get additional information in a pop-up: for example, seat availability
